# Github Profile Achievements
> Achievements that did not make the cut

A [website](https://cqcumbers.com/github_achievements) recognizing Github users
who have achieved various milestones deserving of recognition. Inspired by
[flet/rejected-github-profile-achievements](https://github.com/flet/rejected-github-profile-achievements),
and created with the help of Clickhub's GH Archive playground. The queries used
for each achievement can be seen in `query_badges.sh`.
