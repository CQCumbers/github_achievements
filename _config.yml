header: üéâ Github Profile Achievements
description: >-
  This website recognizes Github users who have achieved various milestones
  deserving of recognition. It was inspired by flet's [Rejected Github Profile
  Achievements](https://github.com/Flet/rejected-github-profile-achievements),
  and created with the help of ClickHouse's [GH Archive
  playground](https://ghe.clickhouse.tech/). Because of this, statistics are
  based only on certain public events, and may ignore actions that took place
  during archive downtime, while including activity on since-deleted
  repositories. You can inspect the queries used in the [github
  repo](https://github.com/cqcumbers/github_achievements).
